## 0hh1 Solver

### Description

This Python script will solve gameboards for 0h h1, created by Martin Kool and found at https://0hh1.com/  

The script follows the same set of logic and rules as a human player and looks for the "next move" in much the same way a human might

## Usage

0hh1-solver requires the user to manually enter in the gameboard as a two-dimensional array  

1. Define n to be the grid dimensions i.e. (n=4 for a 4x4 gameboard)
2. Decide whether you want the program to showAllSteps toward completion, or just the solution
3. Enter the gameboard as you see it (top row is top, left is left, etc.)  
   Empty tiles: leave as 0  
   Red tiles: set to 1  
   Blue tiles: set to 2  
4. Run the script and view its output
